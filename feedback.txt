Domain Modelling: Good job representing the inheritance and composition/aggregation relationships.
For the cardinalities for Entity and File, I would make it 1 to 0.. as for every entity, there are 0 or more files.

Cohesion and Coupling
Good job with trying to minimalise coupling. Good how you abstracted out the FileInfoResponse creation into the Entity class. 
To further improve this, you can move the FileInfoResponse creation into the File class and move the EntityInfoResponse creation 
into the Entity class as well so you won't need to call getters.

Code Quality: Good code style.

Blogging: Great blogging, clear evidence of the process of design thinking and reflection.

Software Testing: Fantastic tests that cover unique cases. Well done!
